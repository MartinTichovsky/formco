                Except for Full Featured examples, the examples are included from formco where they are used for
                integration and unit tests. On the top of the form is a button "Re-Render Form" which re-render the
                whole component with the form. This re-render should not influence the form. That means, the form must
                be still the same. The Submit button will log a result of the form to the browser console if the form is
                valid. The reset button should reset all fields to default.
            </p>
